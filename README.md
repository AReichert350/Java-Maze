### Description: ###
This project is a maze puzzle game created in COSC 3011 in the Spring 2021 semester. For more information on what the game is and how to play see: [User's Manual](https://github.com/AReichert350/Java-Maze/blob/main/docs/UsersManual.docx).

### How to Run: ###
The easiest way to get up and running on Windows is to:
1. Download the zip file of the code (click on the green "Code" button above).
2. Save the files someplace accessible and extract them from the zip file.
3. Open Windows PowerShell.
4. Navigate to the storage location of the extracted files.
5. Once there, navigate to the src directory: "cd game" and "cd src".
6. Run "javac Main.java".
7. Run "java Main" (The program most likely will not find a maze file to load. Select "Open New File" and navigate to the input directory in the file explorer and choose a file.).
